AllegroGraph Java client release process
========================================

# Executive summary
To publish a new release:
  * Ensure that an AG server has been started via `make start-server`.  The server
    will be used to run tests during the `make deploy` step below.
  * ```
make prepare-release
make deploy
make publish-dist
make post-release
```

# Introduction

Java client releases are deployed to the central Maven repository. This 
is a common place from which Java build tools, such as Maven or Gradle, 
download build dependencies.

The central repository does not allow direct upload of archives. It is 
instead regularly synchronized with a few approved hosting services. The 
one that we use is called OSSRH (https://oss.sonatype.org)

The deployment process has two phases:

  * First the project is uploaded to OSSRH ("staged")
  * Then it is approved and released to the central repository.

Unapproved artifacts can be downloaded directly from OSSRH, but will not 
be synced to the central repository.

Coordinates
-----------
Artifacts (i.e. files that can be downloaded) in a Maven repository are 
identified using five values ("coordinates"):

   * groupId - in our case it is going to be `com.franz`
   * artifactId: `allegrograph-java-client`
   * version -  we use version numbers of the form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`,
     starting at 1.0.0. These numbers bear no relation to AllegroGraph's 
     version. See also the note regarding snapshots below.
   * packaging - File type, the default is `jar`.
   * classifier - This value is used to disambiguate between multiple 
     files produced by Maven for the same project. The default value 
     is empty and refers to the binary JAR. Other files deployed with 
     the Java client are:
       * Sources jar (`sources`)
       * Javadocs packaged in a JAR (`javadoc`)
       * Compiled tests (`test`).
        
Note that packaging and classifier are rarely mentioned, as the default 
values are almost always appropriate.

Snapshots
---------
A released Maven artifact cannot be modified in any way. Yet it is often 
desirable to use an in-development version without the need to increment 
the version number every time the code is modified. This can be achieved 
with the use of so called "snapshots". Snapshots are Maven artifacts 
that:

   * Have a version number ending in `-SNAPSHOT` (e.g. `1.0.1-SNAPSHOT`)
   * Are not subject to the "no modifications" restriction mentioned
     above.
   * Are *not* deployed to the central repository, but can be used 
     locally or directly from OSSRH.
   * When comparing versions, a snapshot is considered to be older
     than the corresponding release (`1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` < `1.0.0`).
     
During development the project is generally kept in a snapshot version.
It should only be switched to a regular version during deployment.

# Requirements

There are two basic requirements for deploying the Java client releases 
(aside from Maven and Java that are required to build it): an OSSRH 
 account and access to the GPG key used to sign releases.

## OSSRH account

OSSRH (https://oss.sonatype.org) is the service that hosts the artifacts 
that are later uploaded to the central repository. To deploy a new 
release it is necessary to have an account there, with appropriate 
permissions for the 'com.franz' group.

Credentials for this account should be added to a file named 
`~/m2/settings.xml`. If you do not have such a file, copy the default 
one from `MAVEN_HOME/conf/settings.xml`. On AG development machines the 
full path is /usr/share/apache-maven/conf/settings.xml .

The credentials should look like this: 

```
<server>
  <id>ossrh</id>
  <username>your-ossrh-username</username>
  <password>your-ossrh-password</password>
</server>
```

Consider replacing the username and password with a token, see
http://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/usertoken.html#_accessing_and_using_your_user_tokens .

## GPG key

All releases must be signed using a GPG key for `support@franz.com`.
 
This key must be available in your GPG keyring for the deployment 
process to succeed. 

# Website releases

The release process consists of the following steps:

1. The `-SNAPSHOT` qualifier must be stripped from the version number
   in the POM file and all other files that mention it. This is done
   by invoking `make prepare-release`.

2. Build the distribution tarball and upload to the internal FTP
   server using `make publish-dist`. Note that it can take up to an
   hour before the external FTP servers are synchronized.

   At this step it is recommended to release the client to the Maven
   central repository (see next section).

3. After that the version number must be incremented, -SNAPSHOT needs
   to be added back and the result must be pushed to the git
   server. This is done with `make post-release`.

# Maven central releases

In addition to being published on the website, the client should also
be deployed to the central repository. This is done by calling `make
deploy`. Only final releases (not snapshots) can be published in this
way. Calling `make deploy` will:

1. Compile the code and upload it (stage) to OSSRH. You'll be 
   prompted for the GPG key passphrase.
2. Run the tests against the freshly uploaded JAR. This phase requires 
   a working AllegroGraph server. If that is not desired, set the
   AG_SKIP_TESTS variable to something.
3. Approve the release for sync to the central repository.

It is possible to skip the final step by running 'make stage'. This
will also work for snapshot releases, which are never synced to the
central repository, but are publicly visible on OSSRH.

Once `make stage` finishes successfully, the staged release must be
approved on OSSRH. This can be done by running `make release-staged`
in the same tree in which the deployment happened. `make drop-staged`
can be used to remove the staged build without releasing it.

To approve a release made in another tree (or after the tree has been
cleaned) it is necessary to obtain a staging repository id. Use `make
list-staged` to view all such repositories (there will likely be only
one). Then pass the id to `make` like this: `make release-staged
STAGING_ID=<id>`.

It is also possible (but tedious) to approve a release using the web
interface of OSSRH. To do that:
   
     * Go to https://oss.sonatype.org/ 
     * Make sure you're logged in (there is a 'Log In' button in the 
       upper right hand corner.
     * Click 'Staging Repositories.
     * Enter 'comfranz' into the search box on the top right.
     * Select that item and then click 'Release` at the top of the list.
         
         * You can also choose 'Drop' if something is wrong with the 
           release and you do *not* want to approve it.
     
# Adjusting major/minor version number

The release scripts take care of managing the version number, but only
the patch number is ever incremented. After more serious API changes
the other segments of the version might also need to be adjusted.

See README.md in `version-rewriter/` to learn how to do this.

# Snapshot deployment

The current code can be deployed to OSSRH as a snapshot at any time. 
This can be achieved by doing `make deploy`. This will not cause the 
version number to be modified in any way, the code will just be compiled
and uploaded. Since snapshots are not synchronized to Maven Central no 
approval phase is required.

Users can place the following in their pom.xml file to be able to
reference a snapshot deployment:

```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>oss-sonatype</id>
        <name>oss-sonatype</name>
        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/public/</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```
